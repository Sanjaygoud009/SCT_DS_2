🚢 Task 2 – Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
This is the second task of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

🔹 Task Objective:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice.
The Titanic dataset from Kaggle was selected for this task.

📁 Dataset:
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

File used: train.csv

📌 What I Did:
Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset using Pandas

Cleaned missing values in Age, Embarked, and removed the Cabin column
